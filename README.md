## üìù Project Overview

This project, `test-app-001`, is a minimalist web-based calculator application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It serves as a foundational exercise in front-end web development, demonstrating core HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive logic. The primary goal was to create a functional and user-friendly calculator interface that is accessible directly in a web browser.

## ‚ú® Features

The calculator provides the following core functionalities:

*   **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
*   **Clear Functionality**: A dedicated "C" button to reset the current input and calculation.
*   **Result Display**: A clear display area to show input numbers, selected operators, and the final computed result.
*   **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive button layout for easy number and operator input.
*   **Web-Based Access**: Easily accessible via any modern web browser.
